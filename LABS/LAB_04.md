### Questions to keep in mind...
### 
##
### 1.  Do you have early adopters 
### 2.  How long do you have to get this new tool to be accepted
### 3.  What are problems you expect to arise 
### 4.  Will there be one team or will it be deployed all at once 
### 5.  If there are multiple deployments of the tool how will the company keep it cohesive
